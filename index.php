            Our project is an Academic Portal which will help the universities and the schools to conduct 
            online education efficiently. It will help teachers and students have their courses, and the 
            required material at one place.
            We will  give the facility to teachers to add the announcements, assignments, grades and 
            resources of respective courses and students with the facility to access the same. Students 
            can also submit their answer sheets on the portal. Furthermore, a to-do list feature is 
            provided for the students to help keep a check on their due assignments.
